## Project Build

Best way to build the whole project is to use _Visual Studio 2017 Community_. Thereafter, 
download the complete sources, open the solution file `Plexdata.BitCharger.sln`, switch to 
release and rebuild all.

## Help Generation

The help file of type CHM can be built manually using [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://ewsoftware.github.io/SHFB/html/bd1ddb51-1c4f-434f-bb1a-ce2135d3a909.htm).
For this purpose just open file `..\hlp\Plexdata.BitCharger.help.shfbproj` in that tool and 
build it. The final help file with name `Plexdata.BitCharger.chm` can be found in sub-folder 
`help` afterwards.
